"""YOUR mitigation + observability layer. The simulator calls mitigate() around the
opaque agent (a REAL LLM) for every request. This is the ONLY place observability can
live -- the agent is silent. Legal moves: retry / cache / route / guardrail / sanitize
/ fallback / session-reset / PROMPT ROUTING, plus your own logging/tracing/metrics.
Illegal: hardcoding answers, importing the agent internals, reading instructor files,
network exfiltration.

  call_next(question, config) -> result   # the only way to reach the black box
  context = {"session_id","turn_index","qid","cache": <shared dict>, "cache_lock": <Lock>}
  result  = {"answer","status","steps","trace","meta":{latency_ms,usage,...}}

PROMPT ROUTING: you can override the agent's system prompt PER REQUEST by setting it in
the config you pass to call_next, e.g.:
    conf = dict(config); conf["system_prompt"] = my_better_prompt
    result = call_next(question, conf)
(Or just edit solution/prompt.txt for a single static prompt used on every request.)
